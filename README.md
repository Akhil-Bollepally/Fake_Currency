# Fake Currency Detection System💵
### A Machine Learning Based Web Application

---

## Project Overview
The Fake Currency Detection System is a **Django-based web application** designed to detect whether a currency note is **genuine or fake** using **Machine Learning and image processing techniques**.

The system allows users to upload an image of a currency note through a web interface. The uploaded image is analyzed using a trained machine learning model, and the prediction result is displayed to the user.

This project is developed as a **simple and independent academic project** to demonstrate the practical application of **Machine Learning in real-world security problems**.

## Objectives
- Detect fake currency notes using image-based analysis  
- Apply machine learning techniques for classification  
- Provide a simple web interface for user interaction  
- Demonstrate ML integration with a Django web application

## Dataset & Model Note
Trained machine learning models and datasets are **maintained locally**
and are **not included in this repository** due to file size limitations.

This follows **standard academic and industry best practices**.

---

## Results
- Accurate identification of fake and genuine currency notes
- Fast prediction response
- Improved reliability compared to manual verification

---

## Future Scope
- Support for multiple currency denominations
- Improved accuracy using deep learning models
- Mobile application integration
- Real-time camera-based currency detection

---

## Academic Note
This project is developed as part of **academic learning and self-practice** and demonstrates the practical application of **Machine Learning and Image Processing in security systems**.
